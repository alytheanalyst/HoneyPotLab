# Project Title: Displaying Live Cyber Attacks on Microsoft Sentinel with a Honeypot  
For this project, I set up a Windows virtual machine (VM) in Azure to act as a honeypot, designed to attract and monitor RDP attacks in real time. I created a log repository in Azure to collect data from the VM and configured Microsoft Sentinel (a SIEM) to display a live map showing the geolocations of the attackers. To dig deeper, I used PowerShell scripts to extract the attackers’ IP addresses from the logs and sent them to an API to gather detailed location information. This data was then used to create custom logs with geographic details. The result was a system that not only tracked live attacks but also provided valuable insights into where they were coming from, making it a great example of using automation and visualization for threat monitoring.
